title: "Googleâ€™s Sundar Pichai: Privacy Should Not Be a Luxury Good"

Great article on the necessity of privacy and what Google is doing to allow users to manage their data.

>"Our mission compels us to take the same approach to privacy. For us, that means privacy cannot be a luxury good offered only to people who can afford to buy premium products and services. Privacy must be equally available to everyone in the world."

>"To make privacy real, we give you clear, meaningful choices around your data. All while staying true to two unequivocal policies: that Google will never sell any personal information to third parties; and that you get to decide how your information is used."
